			README FOR TASKS IN LOW-LEVEL PROGRAMMING.

This README contains additional information about the workings of each script and file in this directory.



0x00-hello_world - runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. The C file name will be saved in the variable '$CFILE', and the output saved in the file 'c'.

1-compiler - creates a c file but does not link it. C file will be saved in the variable main.c, output named same as C but with extension '.o' instead of '.c'. The file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.

2-assembler - generates the assembly code of a file and saves it in an output file with same name as the input file. Generates an output with '.s' extension. The file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.

3-name - compiles a c file saved in the variable main.c and creates an executable named 'cisfun'.

4-puts.c - a C program that prints exactly _"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle_ to the stdout using the 'puts' function.

5-printf.c - C program that prints exactly _with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,_ using the printf function.
