			README FOR FUNCTION POINTERS

0-print_name.c - a function that prints a name.

1-array_iterator.c - calls a function to perform an action on each element of an array.

2-int_index.c - calls a function to return the index of an element in array if it is an integer, by comparing it to an integer (courtesy of cmp function that returns a value > 0 if the argument it takes is an int).
