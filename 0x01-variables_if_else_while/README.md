			README FOR VARIABLES, IF ELSE, AND LOOPS PROJECT.

This program contains additional information about the programs, scripts and files in this directory and what they each do.

0-positive_or_negative.c - program that assigns a random number to a variable each time it is executed.

1-last_digit.c - assigns a random number to a variable each time it is executed and prints whether the last digit of the number is >, < or = to a number.

2-print_alphabet.c - program that prints the alphabet in lowecase using the 'putchar' function. This function allows you to print character one at a time, unlike the 'printf'.

3-print_alphabets.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase then in uppercase using the putchar function. 

4-print_alphabt.c - prints the alphabet in lowercase excepting 'q' and 'e' using the 'putchar' function.

5-print_numbers.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 using the 'printf' function.


6-print_numberz.c - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0. Basically, print from 0 - 9. And it's tricky cause you can't just print numbers directly using the putchar function. So we add '0' to the number to be printed in order to get its ASCII value as putchar only prints characters.
