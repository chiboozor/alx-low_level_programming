				README FOR ARGUMENTS TO MAIN

0-whatsmyname.c - this program prints its name followed by a new line. It takes just one argumen: the name of the program.

1-args.c - this function simply prints the number of arguments passed to the command line interface. It prints a 0 if only the name of the program is entered, and subsequently increases with the number of arguments passed to it.

2-args.c - a program that prints ALL  arguments it receives one per line.  

3-mul.c - a program that multiplies two numbers (converted to integers using the 'atoi' function) passed as arguments. An if statement checks if the number of arguments passed is less than or equal to 2 (program name and only one number), at which it prints "Error", and returns 1.

100-change.c - prints the minimum number of coins required to make change for an amount of money.
