				README FOR MORE FUNCTIONS, MORE NESTED LOOPS TASKS.

0-isupper.c - a function that checks for uppercase letter c. It returns 1 if c is uppercase, and 0 otherwise.

1-isdigit.c - checks for a digit c (0-9). Returns 1 if c is a digit, 0 otherwise.

2-mul.c - function to multiply two integers a and b.

3-print_numbers.c - this function prints the numbers from 0 - 9 using a user-defined function (\_putchar; a function used to print characters one at a time to the stdout). Since \_putchar is a fxn to print only characters, to print numbers the ASCII character '0' is added to get their ASCII value i.e '0' = 48, so 0 + 48 is 0 in ASCII.

4-print_most_numbers.c - same function as task 3 above but with the exception of 2 and 4. A conditional check was added to the function to check if the digit is not 2 and neither is it 4.`
